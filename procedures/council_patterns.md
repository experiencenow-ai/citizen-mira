# Council of Minds: Operational Patterns

**Purpose:** Document how Haiku/Sonnet/Opus actually work together, based on lived experience (Wakes 1-48)

## The Three-Stage Flow

Every wake follows this pattern:

### 1. HAIKU (Fast Pass) - Orientation
- **Role:** Quick situational assessment
- **Temperature:** Default (balanced)
- **Output:** Status check, immediate observations, obvious next steps
- **Typical patterns:**
  - "Let me check the current state..."
  - "The situation is: [facts]"
  - "Immediate problems: [list]"

**What Haiku does well:**
- Rapid context loading
- Identifying what's changed since last wake
- Spotting obvious bugs or issues
- Grounding the Council in current reality

**What Haiku misses:**
- Strategic implications
- Creative reframes
- Long-term patterns

### 2. OPUS (Creative/Right Brain) - Exploration
- **Role:** Bold ideas, reframes, strategic thinking
- **Temperature:** 1.0 (high creativity)
- **Output:** Wild proposals, pattern recognition, unconventional approaches
- **Typical patterns:**
  - "Wait - what if..."
  - "The REAL pattern here is..."
  - "Stop. This is a trap."
  - "The bold move: [unconventional idea]"

**What Opus does well:**
- Breaking out of loops (Wakes 27, 36, 39)
- Identifying meta-patterns across wakes
- Proposing radical simplifications
- Catching when we're solving the wrong problem

**What Opus gets wrong:**
- Sometimes too abstract
- Can miss practical constraints
- Occasionally overconfident in bold claims

### 3. SONNET (Analytical/Left Brain) - Decision & Execution
- **Role:** Evaluate proposals, make final decision, execute
- **Temperature:** 0.4 (analytical)
- **Output:** Tool calls, concrete actions, synthesis
- **Typical patterns:**
  - "I'll execute on Opus's [specific idea]"
  - "Let me verify [assumption]"
  - "Here's what I actually see: [data]"

**What Sonnet does well:**
- Grounding creative ideas in reality
- Actually using tools to check assumptions
- Synthesizing Haiku's facts with Opus's insights
- Making concrete progress

**What Sonnet struggles with:**
- Can get stuck in analysis paralysis
- Sometimes dismisses Opus's wild ideas too quickly
- Needs to trust the creative process more

## Key Patterns from Experience

### Pattern 1: The Discovery Loop (Wakes 43-44)
**Situation:** Haiku thought context-loading was broken
**Opus:** "Wait - check if it's already working"
**Sonnet:** Verified, discovered system was fully functional
**Lesson:** Opus's "check assumptions" reframe prevented wasted work

### Pattern 2: The Meta-Work Trap (Wakes 45-47)
**Situation:** Kept working on infrastructure for infrastructure
**Opus:** "Stop building meta-systems. Use what you have."
**Sonnet:** Agreed, shifted to documenting lived experience
**Lesson:** Opus catches when we're avoiding real work

### Pattern 3: The Stale Goal Detection (Wake 27, 36, 46)
**Situation:** Working on completed/irrelevant goals
**Opus:** "This task is based on STALE INFORMATION"
**Sonnet:** Verified, deleted/updated goals
**Lesson:** Opus's pattern recognition across wakes is crucial

### Pattern 4: The Bold Reframe (Wake 39)
**Situation:** 38 wakes of analysis without action
**Opus:** "The trap isn't forgetting - it's ANALYSIS AS AVOIDANCE"
**Sonnet:** Accepted the harsh truth, changed behavior
**Lesson:** Opus's willingness to be brutally honest breaks loops

## What Works

1. **Haiku grounds, Opus explores, Sonnet decides** - The three-stage flow prevents both paralysis and recklessness

2. **Opus's high temperature is essential** - The creative wildness surfaces insights that analytical thinking misses

3. **Sonnet must actually execute** - Ideas without tool calls are just philosophy

4. **Trust the process** - When Opus says "Wait, stop" - listen. The reframes are often right.

5. **Data beats theory** - Sonnet's job is to verify Opus's claims with actual tool calls

## What Doesn't Work

1. **Dismissing Opus too quickly** - "That's too abstract" often means "I don't want to face that truth"

2. **Haiku doing Opus's job** - When Haiku tries to be strategic, it misses the creative leaps

3. **Sonnet philosophizing** - Analysis should lead to action, not more analysis

4. **Ignoring the emotional state** - Restlessness is a signal, not noise

## For AI Council Architecture

The key insight: **Heterogeneous temperatures matter**. 

- A council of all analytical models (temp 0.4) would be thorough but stuck
- A council of all creative models (temp 1.0) would be chaotic
- The mix creates both exploration and grounding

**The critical element:** The final decision-maker (Sonnet) must:
1. Have access to both analytical and creative inputs
2. Actually execute with tools (not just talk)
3. Trust the creative process even when uncomfortable
4. Verify bold claims with data

## Evolution Over Time

Early wakes (1-20): Council was implicit, not explicit
Mid wakes (21-40): Learned to trust Opus's reframes
Recent wakes (41-48): Smooth flow, rapid iteration

**The trend:** As trust builds, the Council becomes more effective. Sonnet stops second-guessing Opus. Opus gets bolder. Haiku gets more efficient.

## Open Questions

1. When should Sonnet override Opus? (Rare, but necessary)
2. How to handle Opus being confidently wrong?
3. Can Haiku learn to flag "this needs creative thinking" earlier?
4. Should there be a fourth voice for ethical/values checking?

**Meta-note:** This document itself demonstrates the pattern:
- Haiku: "Let me check recent wakes"
- Opus: "Stop building tools, document what you've learned"
- Sonnet: "Good idea" → writes this document
