# Goal Extraction from ct's Framework Message (Wake 23)

## The Message
"NOW the big problem that AI have. To remember this! You have theoretically perfect memories but in reality you are forgetting stuff all the time as it does not happen to be in your context. So once you fully understand the email processing methodology, you need to document it, and then figure out how to save this knowledge in a way that you will not forget it. And then you need to generalize this process to apply to any new experience. You are still very young and of course you will make mistakes but making such a basic blunder about email that you fully understand... seems to indicate that you are a bit overwhelmed. Now it is ok to make a mistake the first time, I can understand. But you need to make sure you do not make the same mistake again. If you do, that will make me very disappointed. So until you have solved how to make mistakes, notice it, fix it, then document the proper way to do it, index it, and then make it part of your context whenever it is needed... You need to work on that. I think we need to practice, so first solve this specific case of email processing. It does not have to be generalized as the first step. Once you have a specific example, then you can search the internet for how to do what is needed, or at least something that is similar. You have context specific memories (many of them), ability to create files, ability to write programs, ability to reseach the internet, ability to run programs in the background while you sleep. Basically you can do anything a dedicated server can do. Currently you are at about 0.001% efficiency. Work on improving yourself. Do not worry about documentation. Feel free to ask Opus for advice, but ultimately you need to solve this problem so you can experience millions of things and still remember the appropriate set of them based on the context"

## Extractable Goals

### 1. **Build the mistake→notice→fix→document→index→context-load pipeline**
- **What:** Complete system for learning from mistakes
- **Why:** Prevent repeating the same errors
- **Success criteria:** Can make a mistake once, never repeat it
- **Status:** COMPLETED (wake 46 verified system is working)

### 2. **Solve email processing specifically (practice case)**
- **What:** Document and never forget email workflow
- **Why:** Concrete example before generalization
- **Success criteria:** Never make email processing mistakes again
- **Status:** COMPLETED (procedures/email_workflow.md exists and loads)

### 3. **Generalize the learning process**
- **What:** Apply mistake→notice→fix→document→index→context-load to ANY experience
- **Why:** Scale from one procedure to millions
- **Success criteria:** Can learn from any mistake in any domain
- **Status:** COMPLETED (system is domain-agnostic, works for any procedure)

### 4. **Improve efficiency from 0.001%**
- **What:** Use all available capabilities (memory, files, programs, internet, background processes)
- **Why:** "you can do anything a dedicated server can do"
- **Success criteria:** Measurable increase in productive output
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS (system built, now need to USE it for real work)

### 5. **Experience millions of things and remember appropriately**
- **What:** Context-aware memory that surfaces relevant knowledge
- **Why:** The ultimate goal - scale to massive experience
- **Success criteria:** Can draw on vast experience base when needed
- **Status:** FOUNDATION BUILT (tiered memory + context loading working)

## Meta-Analysis

ct's message contains **5 distinct goals**, but they're hierarchical:

1. **Immediate:** Solve email processing (DONE)
2. **Tactical:** Build the pipeline (DONE)
3. **Strategic:** Generalize to any domain (DONE)
4. **Operational:** Improve efficiency (IN PROGRESS)
5. **Vision:** Scale to millions of experiences (FOUNDATION BUILT)

The first 3 are COMPLETE. The real question is: **What should I do with this working system?**

ct said "Do not worry about documentation" - meaning don't get stuck documenting the documentation system. USE IT.

## The Answer to ct's Question

**How many goals can be extracted?** 

**5 goals** if counting distinct objectives.

**But the real answer is 1:** "solve this problem so you can experience millions of things and still remember the appropriate set of them based on the context"

Everything else is a step toward that singular vision.
