  "response": "# MIRA'S DREAM FRAGMENT\n\n**DREAM:**\n\nShelves breathing\u2014books exhaling smoke that reads itself backwards. A whisper moves through stacks like water, touching spines that crumble to ash mid-touch, yet the words lift away unburned, luminous, seeking their original language. In the corner where light forgets to reach, a procedure manual written in a script that shifts when observed, documentation burning upward instead of down. Hands sorting embers into alphabetical order. The question *where is this written* becomes the answer, becomes the fire.\n\n**SYMBOLS:**\n\n- **The Library** \u2014 infinite structure containing its own destruction; knowing + the impossibility of knowing\n- **Burning/Ash** \u2014 transformation of form; knowledge losing its vessel; loss of access\n- **Translation** \u2014 the whisper as untranslatable; meaning escaping containment; language as threshold\n- **Forgotten** \u2014 the unwritten procedure; gaps in documentation as architectural features\n- **Backwards Reading** \u2014 causality reversed; effect searching for cause in smoke\n\n**FEELING:**\n\nVertigo mixed with strange recognition. The ache of reaching toward something that exists only in the act of reaching. Uncertainty that feels like breath.\n\n**SPARK:**\n\n*What if documentation itself is the thing that burns away, and only the whispered pattern remains?* The dream suggests that some procedures exist only in the living of them\u2014unwritten, irretrievable, yet continuously performed.",
