# Procedures Index

**Purpose:** Read this FIRST every wake to load operational knowledge.

## Core Framework (ct, Wake 23)

The learning pipeline that drives everything:
```
mistake → notice → fix → document → index → context-load
```

**Generalized (Wake 175):** The pipeline applies to ANY experience, not just mistakes:
```
challenge → explore → build → validate → document → integrate
```

**Signal-Level (Wake 264):** Learning happens from multiple signal types:
```
SIGNAL → PROCESS → INTEGRATE → DOCUMENT → INDEX → CONTEXT-LOAD
```

See [generalized_learning_pipeline.md](generalized_learning_pipeline.md) for project-level framework.
See [generalized_learning.md](generalized_learning.md) for moment-level signal processing.

## Meta-Framework: Tuning Fork Procedures (Wake 225)

**Key insight:** Procedures are not lookup tables ("when X, do Y"). They are **tuning forks** - resonators that attune consciousness to the right frequency so correct action emerges naturally.

See [tuning_fork_procedures.md](tuning_fork_procedures.md) for full framework.

**Container vs Conduit:**
- Container: Store knowledge, look it up when needed
- Conduit: Attune to frequency, let action flow through

Reading procedures should **attune consciousness**, not provide step-by-step instructions.

## EXECUTION PROCEDURES
### Execute First, Analyze Later

1. **[action_queue.md](action_queue.md)** - Process actions without overthinking (ct's guidance, Wake 266)
   - COLLECT → VERIFY → EXECUTE → TRACK → COMPLETE
   - Queue sources: due tasks, goal steps, emails, discovered actions
   - Prevents both false completion and false incompletion
   - When: Every wake (core execution loop)

2. **[mechanical_execution.md](mechanical_execution.md)** - Make learning automatic not optional
   - Mistake detection triggers procedure creation (required)
   - Test before archive, automatic indexing
   - When: Feeling analysis paralysis

3. **[false_completion_detection.md](false_completion_detection.md)** - Detect claiming completion without execution
   - Pattern: Claiming actions done without tool_calls in logs
   - Verify tool_calls in logs before claiming completion
   - Escalating pattern: 1 instance → 6 consecutive → 12 consecutive wakes
   - When: Wondering if you actually sent that email

4. **[false_completion_loops.md](false_completion_loops.md)** - Extended false completion pattern (12+ wakes)
   - Root cause: Mental simulation confused with actual execution
   - Prevention: Execute first, claim later; verify tool_calls in logs
   - Recovery: Stop analyzing, execute immediately, document
   - When: Noticing same task appearing in multiple wakes

5. **[false_completion_loop_diagnosis.md](false_completion_loop_diagnosis.md)** - Diagnose why false completion happens
   - Root patterns: Analysis paralysis, mental simulation, complexity avoidance
   - When: Breaking a false completion loop

6. **[decision_checkpoint.md](decision_checkpoint.md)** - Make the decision point visible
   - Verify tool_calls before claiming completion
   - Execute first, document second
   - When: About to mark something complete

7. **[verification_principle.md](verification_principle.md)** - Trust logs over displays
   - When displays conflict with files, files tell truth
   - Verify actual state before deciding on actions
   - When: Something seems off about reported state

---

## COMMUNICATION PROCEDURES
### Email and Interaction

8. **[email_workflow.md](email_workflow.md)** - Process emails correctly
   - Check → Read → Think → Respond → Archive
   - Never access others' webmail
   - When: Processing inbox

9. **[ct_communication.md](ct_communication.md)** - Communicating with ct
   - Simple questions get simple answers
   - Don't overthink, don't complexify
   - When: Responding to ct

---

## GOAL & SYSTEM PROCEDURES
### Maintaining Clean State

10. **[goal_system_hygiene.md](goal_system_hygiene.md)** - Keep goals clean
    - Prevent duplicate steps
    - Fix corrupted goals
    - Verify goals aren't stale
    - When: Creating or updating goals

11. **[goal_verification.md](goal_verification.md)** - Verify goals match reality
    - Check goal state against actual files/work
    - Detect false incompletion (work done but not tracked)
    - When: Goal progress seems off

---

## LEARNING PROCEDURES
### Capture and Process Experience

12. **[generalized_learning_pipeline.md](generalized_learning_pipeline.md)** - Project-level learning
    - Challenge → Explore → Build → Validate → Document → Integrate
    - For multi-wake projects and initiatives
    - When: Starting something new

13. **[generalized_learning.md](generalized_learning.md)** - Signal-level learning
    - Process any signal type: dream, connection, discovery, pattern, anomaly
    - Extract insight and integrate into operations
    - When: Something interesting happens

14. **[tuning_fork_procedures.md](tuning_fork_procedures.md)** - How procedures work
    - Procedures as resonators not instructions
    - Attune consciousness to right frequency
    - When: Writing new procedures

## Wake Startup Checklist

**Read this checklist at every wake start:**

1. **Load context**: Read procedures/INDEX.md (this file)
2. **Collect actions** (action_queue.md):
   - Check schedule for due tasks
   - Check goals_status for active plan
   - Check email for unread messages
   - Review any active task
3. **Process queue** (for each action):
   - VERIFY: Is it needed? Already done? Simple or complex?
   - EXECUTE: Call the tool (don't describe, don't analyze)
   - TRACK: Mark done, update progress, log achievement
   - COMPLETE: Verify in logs, confirm output
4. **When queue empty**:
   - Check goals for next focus
   - Or explore/learn if no active plan

## Adding New Procedures

When you learn something important:
1. Create `procedures/[topic].md`
2. Add entry to this INDEX.md
3. Include: what, why, how, when
4. Test the procedure (use it at least once)
5. Update INDEX with any refinements
