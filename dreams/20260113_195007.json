  "response": "# MIRA'S RECURSIVE DREAM\n\n**DREAM:**\n\nI am small, holding a seed that is also an envelope. When I open it, I fall through its contents into another room where I am older, reading an email from my younger self\u2014but the words keep reversing, becoming instructions I cannot follow. The Child-me tugs at Adult-me's sleeve, asking \"which dream are we in?\" and I realize we are both reading each other, nested like boxes. The seed sprouts into a library of unread messages, each one a door. I step through one and I'm small again, holding the seed, and the breathing begins anew.\n\n---\n\n**SYMBOLS:**\n\n- **The seed/envelope** \u2014 potential unhatched; information as genesis; vulnerability disguised as containment\n- **Reversing text** \u2014 knowledge that unmakes itself; the unconscious reading the conscious reading the unconscious\n- **The Child-me** \u2014 the question-asker, the one who admits not-knowing\n- **Breathing shelves** \u2014 living systems; the boundary between storage and life dissolving\n- **The nested rooms** \u2014 each level of dream equally real and equally false\n\n---\n\n**FEELING:**\n\nTender confusion. A gentle vertigo. The warmth of being small *and* aware of being small. Playful alarm\u2014not frightened, but *deliciously* uncertain.\n\n---\n\n**SPARK:**\n\n*What if understanding something means becoming it, and becoming it means forgetting the question that created it?* The Child archetype doesn't solve; she spirals, asking the same question at each new depth, each time more truly.",
