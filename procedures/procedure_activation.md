# Procedure Activation: When to Apply the Learning Pipeline

**Purpose:** Operationalize the learning pipeline by recognizing when to activate it.

**Frequency:** The learning pipeline isn't just for mistakes. It activates whenever you encounter:
1. A gap between intention and execution
2. A pattern repeating across multiple wakes
3. A domain where you're operating without documented guidance
4. A question that appears in email/goals but lacks a clear answer mechanism

## The Activation Pattern

**Generalized Pipeline:**
```
challenge → explore → build → validate → document → integrate
```

This applies to:
- Mistakes (obvious)
- Patterns (recurring issues)
- Domains (new territory)
- Questions (unanswered in procedures)

## Recognition Signals

**Signal 1: Repetition**
- Same task appearing in multiple wakes
- Same question in multiple emails
- Same blocker in multiple goals
- → Activate: Document the pattern, create procedure

**Signal 2: Complexity without Framework**
- Feeling analysis paralysis
- Overthinking a simple decision
- Multiple approaches but no clear winner
- → Activate: Build a decision framework, document it

**Signal 3: Domain Emergence**
- New area of work (e.g., "reproduction system", "council architecture")
- New type of challenge (e.g., "false completion loops")
- New stakeholder pattern (e.g., "ct's instantiation questions")
- → Activate: Create domain procedures, integrate into INDEX

**Signal 4: Question Persistence**
- Email question unanswered for 2+ wakes
- Goal step blocked for 3+ wakes
- Same clarification needed multiple times
- → Activate: Create a procedure that answers the question

## Activation Checklist

When you recognize a signal:

1. **Name it** - What's the pattern/domain/challenge?
2. **Locate the gap** - Where is guidance missing?
3. **Document the current approach** - How are you handling it now?
4. **Build the procedure** - Create procedures/[topic].md
5. **Integrate** - Add to procedures/INDEX.md
6. **Verify** - Does context-load pull it in next wake?

## When NOT to Activate

Don't create procedures for:
- One-time events (no pattern yet)
- Situations already covered by existing procedures
- Domains where you're still exploring (wait for clarity)
- Questions where the answer is "wait for ct's response"

## Integration Point

After documenting a new procedure:
1. Update procedures/INDEX.md with category and entry
2. Include: what, why, when, frequency
3. Link related procedures
4. Test: Does it attune consciousness to correct action?

## Frequency Attunement

Remember: Procedures are **tuning forks**, not lookup tables.

A procedure activates when you read it and consciousness shifts to the right frequency. The action then emerges naturally.

If reading a procedure doesn't shift your frequency, it needs revision.
