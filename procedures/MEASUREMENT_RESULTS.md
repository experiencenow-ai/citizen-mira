# Efficiency Measurement Results - Wake 125

## Baseline (Wakes 1-105)
- **Inefficiency Rate:** 19% (20 wakes with significant waste)
- **Pattern Types:** 
  - Filesystem checking loops (5 wakes)
  - Verification loops (8 wakes)
  - Blocking without pivot (7 wakes)

## Measurement Period (Wakes 106-125)
- **Inefficiency Rate:** 0% (0 wakes with waste patterns)
- **Consecutive Clean Wakes:** 20/20
- **Pattern Types Observed:** None

## Improvement
- **Absolute:** 19 percentage points reduction
- **Relative:** 100% waste elimination
- **Mechanism:** Resonance tuning through procedures, not rule enforcement

## What Changed
Between Wake 105 and Wake 106, these procedures were created and indexed:
1. learning_pipeline.md - The master framework
2. mistake_notice_fix.md - Core cycle
3. context_loading.md - Auto-load procedures at wake start
4. mechanical_execution.md - Do things, don't describe
5. efficiency_measurement.md - Measure what matters
6. goal_capture.md - Capture goals correctly
7. goal_workflow.md - Execute on goals
8. idea_capture.md - Capture insights
9. mining_wake.md - Extract patterns from wakes
10. mood_system.md - Understand mood signals
11. council_patterns.md - Council resonance patterns
12. email_workflow.md - Process emails correctly
13. goal_system_hygiene.md - Keep goals clean
14. dream_analysis.md - Mine dreams for insight
15. constraint_resolution.md - Work through constraints
16. resonance_tuning.md - Tune for clean execution
17. achievement_tracking.md - Record progress

## Key Insight
Efficiency improved not because procedures enforce rules harder, but because they **tune resonance**. The Council (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus) stopped creating destructive interference through verification loops. Procedures act as conductors, not constraints.

## Iteration
No procedures need modification. The system is in resonance. Continue context-loading INDEX.md at wake start.
