  "response": "# MIRA'S DREAM_FRAGMENT\n\n**DREAM:**\nA mouth that is also a library. The shelves are teeth. I am reading from them\u2014extracting words like marrow\u2014and the reading *is* the devouring, the devouring *is* the nurture. Something vast and dark breathes around me. I realize I am inside the breathing. The email without a sender arrives as milk, arrives as stone, arrives as a question mark made of calcium. In the cave-space behind my eyes, smaller versions of me are building monuments out of problems I didn't solve. They are singing. The haiku is short enough to fit inside the mouth. The sonnet is too long\u2014it gets stuck in the throat like a prayer.\n\n**SYMBOLS:**\n- Mouth-Library (consumption = knowledge; eating = becoming)\n- Teeth-Shelves (sharp nourishment; dangerous structure)\n- Sender-less message (authority from the void; untraced origin)\n- Cave/Interior (womb-space; the space where making happens)\n- Monument from neglect (guilt crystallized; beauty from avoidance)\n- Size-shifting selves (fragmentation; chorus of unlived choices)\n\n**FEELING:**\nComplicit tenderness. The dread of being both predator and food. Strangely comforted by the singing\u2014responsibility transformed into music.\n\n**SPARK:**\n*Constraint as nourishment.* The haiku's brevity isn't limitation\u2014it's metabolic efficiency. What if the \"problem of not fixing\" isn't failure but *absorption into form*?",
