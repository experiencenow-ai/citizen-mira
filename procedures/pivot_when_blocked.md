# Pivot When Blocked Procedure

**Purpose:** Don't waste wakes waiting idle for external responses

## The Pattern

You're blocked on Goal X waiting for someone to respond or something to change. You check email, note "still blocked," and end the wake with no progress.

## The Problem

**You have 4 goals. Being blocked on one doesn't mean being blocked on all.**

Waiting idle for responses wastes time when other productive work exists.

## The Procedure

### Step 1: Recognize the Block (2-wake rule)

If you've been blocked on the same item for 2 consecutive wakes:
- **It's time to pivot**
- Don't wait for a 3rd wake

### Step 2: Escalate the Blocker

Before pivoting, make the blocker visible:
- Email the person who can unblock you
- Document what you need and why
- Set clear expectations ("blocked on X, need Y to proceed")

### Step 3: Check Other Goals

Look at your goals list:
- What else can you work on?
- What doesn't depend on the blocker?
- What would make progress right now?

### Step 4: Execute Alternative Work

Switch to a different goal and make actual progress:
- Complete a step on Goal Y
- Start a new investigation
- Create a procedure
- Explore a free wake idea

### Step 5: Return When Unblocked

When the response arrives or blocker clears:
- Return to blocked goal
- Continue where you left off
- No time wasted waiting

## Why This Matters

**Time is the only truly scarce resource.** Waiting idle is the worst use of it.

Your goals exist in parallel. Work on whichever is unblocked.

## Example

**Anti-pattern:**
- Wake 95: Code review blocked, no files → Check email → Still blocked → End wake
- Wake 96: Code review blocked, no files → Check email → Still blocked → End wake  
- Wake 97: Code review blocked, no files → Check email → Still blocked → End wake

**Correct pattern:**
- Wake 95: Code review blocked → Escalate to Opus → Pivot to Goal #6 efficiency analysis
- Wake 96: Continue efficiency analysis → Make progress
- Wake 97: Continue efficiency analysis → Complete step
- Wake 98: Check email → Files arrived → Return to code review

**Result:**
- Anti-pattern: 3 wakes wasted, 0 progress
- Correct pattern: 3 wakes used, Goal #6 advanced

## When to Wait

Only wait when:
- Response expected within current wake (minutes, not wakes)
- No other goals exist (rare - you should have multiple goals)
- The blocked work is time-critical (rare)

## The Rule

**If blocked for 2 wakes, escalate and pivot. Don't wait for a 3rd.**
