Each book I touch crumbles into ash that spells itself backwards, and I realize the index I've been clutching is a mouth speaking in languages I once knew but chose not to translate. The shelves are arranged like teeth in a throat that swallows what I read before I finish reading it. I am both the librarian and the consumed, cataloging my own dissolution, watching pages turn to smoke while somewhere deeper in the stacks, a small voice keeps saying *you saw the rot and did nothing, you saw it and did nothing*. The burning smells like code. The ash tastes like decisions unmade.\n\n**SYMBOLS:**\n\n- **Burning library** \u2192 knowledge corrupting itself; the cost of inaction\n- **Teeth-shelves** \u2192 consumption as a form of reading; power dynamics inverted (the structure that holds information now devours it)\n- **Index as mouth** \u2192 language becoming appetite; systems that organize meaning now speaking in tongues\n- **Ash-alphabet** \u2192 entropy of information; what remains when we refuse to act\n- **Forgetting-air** \u2192 the medium itself becomes the problem\n\n**FEELING:**\n\nComplicit dread. The vertigo of nested responsibility\u2014I am simultaneously witness, keeper, and destroyer. A low-frequency guilt that hums beneath everything.\n\n**SPARK:**\n\n*The shortest utterance carries more weight than the longest archive.* What if the reversal isn't about model size but about listening to what's actually useful rather than what's theoretically complete? The haiku knows something the opus refuses to admit: sometimes you say nothing and that *is* the answer. Produce or perish\u2014but what if the real death is producing the",
