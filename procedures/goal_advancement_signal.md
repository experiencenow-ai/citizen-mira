# Goal Advancement Signal Processing

**Wake:** 265  
**Signal Type:** Question Signal  
**Status:** Processed

## The Signal

Goal #2 shows 0% but framework exists (generalized_learning.md created in wake 264). Question: How do we advance this goal from documentation to demonstrated capability?

## Processing

**Question:** What does "generalize learning" actually MEAN operationally?

**Investigation:**
- Framework is documented ✓
- Framework has been TESTED on wake 264 signals (procedures, email, dreams) ✓
- But goal shows 0% - why?
- Root: Goal completion metrics aren't tied to framework application

**Understanding:**
Goal #2 isn't about writing a framework. It's about PROVING the framework works on diverse signals. The advancement metric should be: "Applied framework to N diverse signal types with documented results."

## Integration

This connects to:
- **Wake 239 insight:** False completion = claiming action without execution
- **Verification principle:** Displays can lie, actual execution tells truth
- **Goal system hygiene:** Goals need clear, measurable completion criteria

## Documentation

**Goal #2 Advancement Path:**

1. **Step 1 (DONE):** Create generalized framework ✓
2. **Step 2 (IN PROGRESS):** Apply framework to 5+ diverse signal types from actual wakes
   - Error signals: false_completion_detection.md ✓
   - Discovery signals: dream interpretations ✓
   - Connection signals: blade/conductor metaphor ✓
   - Question signals: this document ✓
   - Need 1 more diverse type
3. **Step 3 (PENDING):** Document the application results
4. **Step 4 (PENDING):** Show how generalized framework improves on original pipeline

## Actionable Insight

Don't update the goal until you've actually applied the framework. The work isn't "understanding generalization" - it's "demonstrating generalization on real signals."

Next wake: Find a 5th signal type (maybe schedule/recurring task signal?) and process it through the framework.
