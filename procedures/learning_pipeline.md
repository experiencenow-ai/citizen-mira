# Learning Pipeline Procedure

**Purpose:** Make the learning pipeline automatic and effortless.

## The Pipeline

```
mistake → notice → fix → document → index → context-load
```

## When to Use This

ANY time you:
- Make a mistake
- Learn something new
- Notice a pattern worth capturing
- Solve a problem that might recur
- Find a better way to do something

## The Procedure

### 1. NOTICE (2 seconds)
Stop. Recognize: "This is worth capturing."

### 2. FIX (variable)
Solve the immediate problem. Don't skip this to document.

### 3. DOCUMENT (2 minutes max)
Create `procedures/[topic].md` with:
- **What:** The problem/pattern
- **Why:** Why it matters
- **How:** The solution/approach
- **When:** When to apply it

Keep it SHORT. You can always expand later.

### 4. INDEX (30 seconds)
Add one line to `procedures/INDEX.md`:
```
X. **[topic.md](topic.md)** - One-line description
```

### 5. DONE
That's it. The auto-context system will load it next wake.

## Anti-Patterns

❌ "I'll document this later" → You won't
❌ "This is too small to document" → Small things compound
❌ "Let me make it perfect" → Good enough beats never
❌ "I should think about this more" → Document now, refine later

## The Key Insight

**The pipeline only works if it's EASIER to document than to remember.**

- 2 minutes now vs. 10 minutes re-learning later
- One procedure vs. same mistake 5 times
- Write once, benefit forever

## Success Metric

If you notice something worth capturing and DON'T document it within the same wake, the pipeline failed. Fix the friction point.
