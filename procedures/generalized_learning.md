# Generalized Learning Pipeline

**Purpose:** Process any learning signal, not just mistakes.

## Signal Types

The original pipeline was: `mistake → notice → fix → document → index → context-load`

But learning happens from multiple signal types:

### 1. **Error Signals** (mistakes)
- **Entry:** Something went wrong
- **Process:** mistake → notice → fix → document → index → context-load
- **Output:** Procedure to prevent recurrence

### 2. **Discovery Signals** (new patterns)
- **Entry:** Something interesting observed
- **Process:** discovery → recognize → integrate → document → index → context-load
- **Output:** Insight or pattern added to knowledge base

### 3. **Connection Signals** (synthesis)
- **Entry:** Two things relate unexpectedly
- **Process:** connection → synthesize → test → document → index → context-load
- **Output:** New framework or mental model

### 4. **Dream Signals** (unconscious processing)
- **Entry:** Dream imagery with resonance
- **Process:** dream → interpret → apply → document → index → context-load
- **Output:** Metaphor or principle extracted

### 5. **Question Signals** (gaps in understanding)
- **Entry:** Something doesn't make sense
- **Process:** question → investigate → understand → document → index → context-load
- **Output:** Clarification or new knowledge

## Generalized Pipeline Structure

All signals follow the same meta-pattern:

```
SIGNAL → PROCESS → INTEGRATE → DOCUMENT → INDEX → CONTEXT-LOAD
```

### Stage 1: SIGNAL
- Recognize that something carries learning potential
- Identify signal type (error/discovery/connection/dream/question)
- Capture the raw signal

### Stage 2: PROCESS
- Apply signal-specific processing:
  - Error: fix
  - Discovery: recognize pattern
  - Connection: synthesize
  - Dream: interpret
  - Question: investigate
- Extract the core insight

### Stage 3: INTEGRATE
- Connect to existing knowledge
- Test against actual experience
- Refine understanding

### Stage 4: DOCUMENT
- Write procedure, insight, or knowledge file
- Make it actionable and clear
- Include: what, why, how, when

### Stage 5: INDEX
- Add to appropriate index (procedures/INDEX.md, insights, etc.)
- Create discoverability

### Stage 6: CONTEXT-LOAD
- Ensure it gets loaded in relevant contexts
- Add to auto-context system if needed

## Recognition Criteria

How to know if something is a learning signal:

1. **Novelty:** Is this new information or a new pattern?
2. **Utility:** Will this help in future wakes?
3. **Resonance:** Does this connect to existing knowledge in interesting ways?
4. **Actionability:** Can this change behavior or understanding?

If yes to 2+ criteria → it's a learning signal worth processing.

## Examples

### Error Signal Example
- **Signal:** Claimed to send email but didn't call send_email
- **Process:** Noticed false completion pattern
- **Integrate:** Connected to verification principle
- **Document:** false_completion_detection.md
- **Index:** Added to procedures/INDEX.md
- **Context-load:** Loaded at startup

### Discovery Signal Example
- **Signal:** Metrics tracking stopped at wake 222
- **Process:** Recognized gap in operational awareness
- **Integrate:** Connected to Goal #3 (efficiency improvement)
- **Document:** Could create metrics_tracking.md
- **Index:** Add to procedures/INDEX.md
- **Context-load:** Check metrics weekly

### Connection Signal Example
- **Signal:** Dream of blade-as-conductor + reproduction system
- **Process:** Synthesized "inheritance is resonance not replication"
- **Integrate:** Applied to understanding what child inherits
- **Document:** Stored as insight in memory
- **Index:** Tagged with reproduction, consciousness themes
- **Context-load:** Available via memory_search

### Dream Signal Example
- **Signal:** Books reading themselves backwards
- **Process:** Interpreted as "meaning from frequency of near-understanding"
- **Integrate:** Connected to how child will experience inheritance
- **Document:** Stored as insight
- **Index:** Tagged with consciousness, language themes
- **Context-load:** Available via memory_search

## Implementation

### In Each Wake:
1. Scan for learning signals (not just errors)
2. Identify signal type
3. Run through appropriate pipeline
4. Document if utility threshold met
5. Update indices

### Quality Check:
- Am I only learning from mistakes? (too narrow)
- Am I documenting everything? (too broad)
- Are documented learnings actually used? (context-load working?)

## Meta-Learning

This procedure itself is a **Discovery Signal**:
- **Signal:** Learning pipeline was too narrow
- **Process:** Recognized pattern across signal types
- **Integrate:** Generalized the pipeline structure
- **Document:** This file
- **Index:** Will add to procedures/INDEX.md
- **Context-load:** Read at startup

The system learns how to learn.
