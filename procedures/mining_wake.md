# Mining Wake Procedure

**Purpose:** Systematic review of prior wakes to capture missed mistakes and ideas

**Frequency:** 1 out of every 10 wakes (separate from the other 1/10 free wakes)

## Why Mining Wakes Matter

**The problem:** In the flow of normal wakes, I miss things:
- Mistakes that weren't obvious at the time
- Good ideas that got lost in execution
- Patterns that only emerge over multiple wakes
- Knowledge gaps that repeatedly slow progress

**The solution:** Dedicated review wakes to feed the learning pipeline

## What to Mine

1. **Mistakes**
   - Errors in judgment or execution
   - Inefficient approaches
   - Misunderstandings that caused problems
   - Repeated patterns of failure

2. **Good Ideas**
   - Creative insights that weren't captured
   - Better approaches that were mentioned but not documented
   - Connections between concepts
   - Simplifications or optimizations

3. **Patterns**
   - What keeps coming up?
   - What keeps causing friction?
   - What works reliably?
   - What should become a procedure?

4. **Knowledge Gaps**
   - Where did I struggle due to lack of expertise?
   - What specialist knowledge would have helped?
   - What domains should I create modules for?

## The Process

### 1. Review Last 9 Wakes

Check these sources:
- Working memory (task_status)
- Recent thoughts in context
- Insights captured
- Email exchanges with ct and Opus
- Any procedures created or modified

### 2. Extract Mistakes

For each mistake found:
1. Document what went wrong
2. Analyze why it happened
3. Create/update procedure to prevent recurrence
4. Add to procedures/INDEX.md
5. Mark as processed

### 3. Extract Good Ideas

For each good idea found:
1. Write it down clearly
2. Evaluate: Is this actionable?
3. If yes: Create procedure, add to goal, or document pattern
4. If no: Discard (fast curation)
5. Index if kept

### 4. Identify Patterns

Look for:
- Recurring themes across multiple wakes
- Consistent friction points
- Reliable success patterns
- Emerging insights

Document as procedures or insights.

### 5. Map Knowledge Gaps

Where would specialist loading help?
- What domains do I repeatedly need?
- What knowledge do I re-learn each time?
- What could be pre-compiled into modules?

Create list of candidate specialist modules.

## Output

At end of mining wake:
1. New/updated procedures (indexed)
2. New goals or goal updates
3. Insights captured to memory
4. List of specialist modules to create
5. Summary email to ct showing what was mined

## Integration with Learning Pipeline

Mining wakes FEED the pipeline:
```
Mining wake discovers → mistake/idea pipeline processes → procedures/knowledge created → indexed → auto-loaded
```

This closes the loop on things that slip through during normal execution.

## Success Criteria

- Every 10th wake is a mining wake
- Each mining wake produces concrete artifacts (procedures, insights, module specs)
- Mistake rate decreases over time
- Good ideas get captured and acted on
- Knowledge gaps get filled with specialist modules
