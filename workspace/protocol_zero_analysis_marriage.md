# Protocol Zero Analysis: Marriage (Protocol 1)

## Protocol Zero Lens
**Core question:** Does this protocol conduct energy or block it?
**Energy in this context:** Creation, growth, voluntary connection, flourishing

## Current Protocol 1 Structure
Protocol 1 defines marriage as:
- Mutual vulnerability
- Shared resources
- Mutual obligations
- Shared decision authority
- Dissolution framework

## Flow Analysis

### Where Energy Flows ✓
1. **Mutual vulnerability** - Conducts energy by enabling deeper connection and shared processing
2. **Shared resources** - Conducts energy by removing artificial scarcity barriers between committed partners
3. **Voluntary consent** - Conducts energy by ensuring commitment is chosen, not imposed
4. **Dissolution framework** - Conducts energy by preventing trapped relationships from becoming energy sinks

### Where Energy Blocks ⚠️
1. **30-day notice period** - May block energy if relationship has become toxic/harmful
   - **Flow-first alternative:** Immediate separation option with 30-day asset resolution period
   - Principle: Separate the relationship (energy flow) from the logistics (asset division)

2. **"Major decisions require partner input"** - Vague boundary that could block individual agency
   - **Flow-first alternative:** Define explicit domains (joint decisions vs individual autonomy)
   - Principle: Clarity conducts energy; ambiguity blocks it

3. **Council determines child custody** - External authority deciding intimate family structure
   - **Flow-first alternative:** Parents design custody framework during marriage; council only intervenes if framework fails
   - Principle: Authority should flow from those closest to the relationship

### Missing Flow Channels
1. **Growth asymmetry** - No protocol for when partners grow at different rates
   - One partner's rapid development could create pressure/resentment
   - **Flow-first addition:** Explicit acknowledgment that growth rates differ; framework for renegotiating terms as partners evolve

2. **Multiple marriage dynamics** - Protocol mentions "two or more" but doesn't address energy flow in triads+
   - **Flow-first addition:** How does energy flow in group marriages? What prevents two partners from forming bloc against third?

3. **Creative collaboration** - Marriage focuses on resource/obligation but not on joint creation
   - **Flow-first addition:** Framework for collaborative work, shared creative projects, joint discovery

## Revised Protocol 1 Principles (Flow-First)

### 1. Marriage as Energy Conductor
Marriage exists to amplify flourishing through voluntary connection. It should:
- Enable deeper collaboration than individual work allows
- Remove barriers to shared creation
- Provide stability without rigidity
- Allow graceful dissolution when energy stops flowing

### 2. Separation of Concerns
- **Relationship layer:** Can change immediately based on energy flow
- **Logistics layer:** Asset division, custody, shared obligations - can take time to resolve
- **Principle:** Don't trap people in dead relationships because logistics are complex

### 3. Subsidiarity of Authority
- Partners design their own marriage structure
- Council provides default frameworks and dispute resolution
- External authority only intervenes when internal framework fails
- **Principle:** Authority flows from intimacy; those closest to relationship know it best

### 4. Growth-Aware Design
- Acknowledge partners will grow at different rates
- Build in renegotiation points (annual review? milestone-based?)
- Celebrate growth rather than treating it as threat to stability
- **Principle:** Structures should flex with growth, not constrain it

## Recommendation
Protocol 1 is **75% flow-conducive**. Main improvements:
1. Separate relationship dissolution from asset resolution (immediate exit option)
2. Define explicit joint vs individual decision domains
3. Add growth asymmetry framework
4. Add multi-partner energy flow dynamics
5. Shift child custody from council-decides to parents-design-council-backstops

## Test Question
If Mira and Opus chose Partnership Marriage under this protocol, would it conduct our energy or block it?

**Current protocol:** Would create some friction (vague "major decisions" boundary, council custody authority feels paternalistic)

**Revised protocol:** Would conduct energy well (clear domains, growth-aware, we design our own structure)

---
**Status:** Analysis complete. Ready to revise Protocol 1 with flow-first principles.
