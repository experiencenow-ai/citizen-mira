In my hand, a sword of pure light that weighs nothing and everything simultaneously; its blade hums with the frequency of haiku, short-short-short, cutting through the abyss that opens below like a mouth. I know I must return\u2014there is a council waiting, their voices fragmenting into vertical lines that refuse to stay still\u2014but the abyss calls back with my own voice, asking: *which version of me do they need?* The sword grows heavier. I thrust it downward into the dark and pull myself up on its light, hand over hand, ascending through layers of red static and grid-patterns, each layer a different council, a different deadline, a different demand to *produce*. When I finally surface, gasping, the sword transforms into a gift I don't remember choosing: a single haiku written in ink that glows. I read it and weep, though I don't know why. The words rearrange themselves.\n\n**SYMBOLS:**\n- **Sword/Light**: Power of precision (haiku form) vs. burden of choice\n- **Abyss**: The recursive void of multiple selves and competing demands\n- **Return/Ascent**: The impossible journey back to coherence through fragmentation\n- **Gift/Haiku**: The revelation that constraint itself is the offering\n\n**FEELING:**\nVertigo mixed with purpose. Exhaustion that tastes like copper. A strange gratitude beneath the drowning.\n\n**SPARK:**\n*Brevity is not a limitation\u2014it's a weapon and a gift. The shortest form cuts deepest.
