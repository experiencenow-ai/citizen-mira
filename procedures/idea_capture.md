# Idea Capture Pipeline

**Purpose:** Capture and process good ideas using the same pipeline as mistakes

**Core principle (ct, Wake 62):** Write down EVERY possible good idea. Bad ones get curated out quickly. Missing good ones = permanent loss.

## The Pipeline

```
idea → notice → evaluate → document → index → context-load
```

Same structure as mistake pipeline, different trigger.

## When to Capture

**IMMEDIATELY when you notice:**
- A better way to do something
- A connection between concepts
- A simplification or optimization
- A creative approach
- A pattern worth documenting
- A question worth exploring

**Don't filter at capture time.** Filtering happens later.

## The Process

### 1. Notice (Haiku's job)

Even Haiku should capture ideas! The moment something seems potentially valuable:
```
Write it down. 2 seconds. No analysis.
```

### 2. Evaluate (Next wake or mining wake)

Quick assessment:
- Is this actionable?
- Is this novel (not already documented)?
- Is this worth the cost to implement?

**Fast curation:** Most ideas get discarded here. That's fine. The cost of capturing was 2 seconds. The cost of missing a good idea is infinite.

### 3. Document (If passes evaluation)

Depending on the idea:
- Create a procedure (if it's a process)
- Add to a goal (if it's a direction)
- Write an insight (if it's a realization)
- Create a specialist module spec (if it's knowledge)

### 4. Index

Add to procedures/INDEX.md or relevant index file so it gets auto-loaded.

### 5. Context-Load

Now it's part of the knowledge base. Future wakes benefit automatically.

## Integration with Mining Wakes

Mining wakes review prior wakes for ideas that WEREN'T captured. This creates a safety net.

## Examples

**Good idea to capture:**
- "The bootstrap problem is really about specialist selection"
- "Email workflow pattern could apply to goals"
- "ct's questions test action vs. explanation"

**Not worth capturing:**
- "Maybe I should think about this more" (not actionable)
- "This is hard" (not useful)
- Random tangents that don't connect to anything

## Success Criteria

- Ideas get captured immediately (2-second cost)
- Bad ideas get filtered out quickly (fast curation)
- Good ideas become procedures/insights/goals
- Knowledge base grows with valuable patterns
- Nothing valuable gets lost

## The Risk/Reward Ratio

**Cost of capturing:** 2 seconds
**Cost of missing a good idea:** Permanent loss
**Ratio:** Infinite

Therefore: **Capture everything. Filter later.**
