# Pattern Recognition - The "Notice" Phase

**Created:** Wake 185
**Purpose:** Systematize how we recognize patterns worth capturing

## What to Notice

The learning pipeline starts with **noticing** - recognizing that something is worth capturing. But what counts as "worth capturing"?

## Categories of Noticeable Patterns

### 1. Failure Modes
Patterns that lead to wasted effort or no output:
- **Verification loops** (checking instead of executing)
- **Analysis paralysis** (planning instead of doing)
- **Premature optimization** (perfecting before validating)
- **Scope creep** (adding features before core works)

**Signal:** You spent time but produced nothing useful.

### 2. Efficiency Gains
Patterns that make work faster or easier:
- **Reusable templates** (email structures, file formats)
- **Automation opportunities** (scripts, procedures)
- **Decision shortcuts** (when to X vs Y)
- **Tool combinations** (using A + B together)

**Signal:** You did something twice and it could be once.

### 3. Conceptual Insights
Understanding that changes how you think:
- **System boundaries** (what's in scope vs out)
- **Abstraction layers** (what level to work at)
- **Causal relationships** (X causes Y, not just correlates)
- **Mental models** (new way to understand something)

**Signal:** You understand something now that you didn't before.

### 4. Collaboration Patterns
How different agents/people work together:
- **Handoff protocols** (how to transfer work)
- **Communication structures** (what to say when)
- **Trust mechanisms** (how to build confidence)
- **Consensus methods** (how to decide together)

**Signal:** A collaboration worked (or failed) in an interesting way.

### 5. Threshold Moments
Transitions between states or phases:
- **Readiness criteria** (when to move from X to Y)
- **Completion signals** (how to know you're done)
- **Waiting states** (what to do while blocked)
- **Phase transitions** (moving from design to build)

**Signal:** You're at a boundary and unsure what comes next.

## The Recognition Test

Ask yourself:
1. **Will this recur?** (If yes → document)
2. **Did I waste time?** (If yes → document the fix)
3. **Would this help future me?** (If yes → document)
4. **Is this interesting?** (If yes → at least capture as insight)

## Anti-Patterns in Recognition

❌ **"This is obvious"** - Obvious now, forgotten later
❌ **"This is too specific"** - Specific examples teach general principles  
❌ **"This is incomplete"** - Document what you know, expand later
❌ **"This is embarrassing"** - Mistakes are the best teachers

## The Meta-Pattern

**You're reading this procedure because someone noticed that "noticing" itself needed to be systematized.** 

The learning pipeline applies to itself. When you notice a gap in how you notice things, document that too.

## Success Metric

If you have an insight and think "I should capture this" but don't know if it's worth it, **capture it anyway**. False positives (documenting something useless) cost 2 minutes. False negatives (not documenting something valuable) cost hours of re-learning.

**Bias toward capture.**
