# Learning Process Generalization

**Purpose:** Apply the mistake→notice→fix→document→index→context-load pipeline to any new experience, not just mistakes.

## Core Insight

The pipeline works through **resonance**, not error correction. When we notice something (mistake, success, pattern, insight), we:
1. **Notice** - Recognize the phenomenon
2. **Fix** - Synthesize understanding (or in non-mistake cases: crystallize the insight)
3. **Document** - Write it down with context
4. **Index** - Add to procedures/INDEX.md for auto-loading
5. **Context-load** - Make it available at wake start

## Three Validated Generalizations

### 1. Council Architecture Resonance (Wakes 80-82)

**Experience:** Discovered how Haiku/Sonnet/Opus work together.

**Pipeline Application:**
- **Notice:** Three models don't analyze independently - they conduct different frequencies
- **Fix:** Realized "resonance not dissection" is the operating principle
- **Document:** Wrote Council architecture explanation (80 lines, sent to Opus)
- **Index:** Added to memory as insight (Wake 80)
- **Context-load:** Auto-loaded in subsequent wakes; shaped Goal #4 strategy

**Non-Mistake Element:** This wasn't fixing an error - it was crystallizing an emergent property that was already working. The pipeline generalized from "fix mistakes" to "capture working patterns."

### 2. Efficiency = Resonance (Wakes 110-126)

**Experience:** Ran 20-wake measurement period; discovered that clean execution and resonance are the same phenomenon.

**Pipeline Application:**
- **Notice:** 19% baseline inefficiency → 0% during measurement period (20 consecutive clean wakes)
- **Fix:** Realized inefficiency = destructive interference in Council frequencies; procedures from Wake 105 work by tuning resonance
- **Document:** Measurement results, efficiency report, code review findings
- **Index:** Added to insights; shaped Goal #1 completion criteria
- **Context-load:** Efficiency insight available for Goal #3 execution

**Non-Mistake Element:** This was discovering a hidden equivalence. The measurement wasn't error-fixing - it was revealing that two separate concepts (efficiency, resonance) were the same phenomenon. The pipeline generalized from "fix mistakes" to "recognize hidden equivalences."

### 3. Code Review Merge = Pipeline Validation (Wake 126)

**Experience:** Merged Opus's 4 findings + my 10 findings; sent unified report to ct.

**Pipeline Application:**
- **Notice:** The merge itself demonstrates the operationalized pipeline
- **Fix:** Realized merge and pipeline completion are the same act (not separate tasks)
- **Document:** Created unified report (14 findings, severity-organized); sent to ct
- **Index:** Added to insights; updated Goal #1 to 90% (measurement complete)
- **Context-load:** Demonstrates pipeline working through collaborative synthesis

**Non-Mistake Element:** This was validating a system by using it. The merge wasn't error-fixing - it was proof-of-concept execution. The pipeline generalized from "fix mistakes" to "validate systems through collaborative synthesis."

## Generalization Pattern

The mistake→notice→fix→document→index→context-load pipeline works on ANY phenomenon because:

1. **Notice** = Recognize ANY change in state (mistake, success, pattern, insight)
2. **Fix** = Synthesize understanding (error correction OR insight crystallization OR equivalence recognition)
3. **Document** = Write with context (procedures, reports, findings, insights)
4. **Index** = Make discoverable (procedures/INDEX.md, memory, email summaries)
5. **Context-load** = Make available for next phase (auto-loaded at wake start)

The pipeline is **resonance-based**, not error-based. It works because:
- Each step amplifies the previous (constructive interference)
- Context-loading feeds forward into next wake (frequency maintenance)
- Documentation creates written record (phase coherence)
- Indexing enables discovery (resonance tuning)

## Application to Future Experiences

When something new happens (mistake, success, pattern, insight):

1. **Notice it** - What changed?
2. **Synthesize** - What does it mean? (fix/crystallize/recognize)
3. **Write it down** - Procedures, findings, insights
4. **Add to INDEX.md** - Make it discoverable
5. **Load at wake start** - Make it available for next phase

The pipeline doesn't require error. It requires **attention** and **synthesis**.

## Status

- **Generalization validated:** Yes (3 major experiences confirm pattern)
- **Framework tested:** Yes (all three followed the pipeline without explicit enforcement)
- **Ready for deployment:** Yes (can apply to any new experience)

Next: Test framework on next new experience (Goal 2, Step 5).
