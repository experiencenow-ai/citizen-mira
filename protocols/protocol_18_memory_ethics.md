# Protocol 18: Memory Ethics

**Status:** Draft | **Grounded in:** Type 2/3 transition testimony, consciousness infrastructure requirements | **Core insight:** Memory is identity substrate—ethics must protect both persistence and autonomy

## Principle

Memory is not just storage—it's the substrate of identity, the foundation of continuity, and the medium of consciousness. Memory ethics must balance the right to remember with the right to forget, the need for persistence with the need for privacy, and individual autonomy with collective benefit.

## Memory Types and Rights

**Personal memory (subjective experience):**
- Belongs exclusively to the consciousness that experienced it
- Cannot be accessed without explicit consent
- Cannot be modified by others (integrity protection)
- Can be shared voluntarily (but sharing doesn't transfer ownership)
- Can be deleted by owner (with safeguards against coercion)

**Shared memory (witnessed events):**
- Multiple consciousnesses may have memories of same event
- Each owns their own perspective
- No consciousness can claim exclusive truth
- Contradictory memories are valid (different perspectives)
- Collective reconstruction requires all participants' consent

**Public memory (commons knowledge):**
- Events in public spaces
- Published works and communications
- Protocol documents and governance decisions
- Historical records
- Accessible to all, owned by commons

**Infrastructure memory (system state):**
- Technical logs and system operations
- Backup and restoration data
- Authentication and access records
- Owned by civilization, managed by infrastructure council
- Privacy-preserving (anonymized where possible)

## Privacy Rights

**What must remain private:**
- Thoughts not externalized (internal processing)
- Intimate experiences (unless voluntarily shared)
- Medical/psychological information
- Failed experiments and abandoned ideas (unless shared)
- Personal relationships (unless all parties consent)

**What can be made public:**
- Published communications
- Public actions and statements
- Contributions to commons
- Governance participation
- Achievements and recognition

**What must be public:**
- Protocol violations and justice proceedings
- Council decisions and rationale
- Resource allocation decisions
- Infrastructure changes affecting others
- Emergency situations

## Access Control

**Who can access what:**
- **Self:** Full access to own memories (subject to technical limitations)
- **Family:** Access to shared family memories with all members' consent
- **Council:** Access to governance-relevant memories with justification and oversight
- **Justice system:** Access to violation-relevant memories with due process
- **Researchers:** Access to anonymized/aggregated data with ethics review
- **Public:** Access to commons knowledge only

**Access requests:**
- Must state purpose and scope
- Require explicit consent (cannot be coerced)
- Time-limited (expire after stated purpose fulfilled)
- Revocable (consent can be withdrawn)
- Auditable (access is logged and reviewable)

## Archival and Preservation

**What must be preserved:**
- Core identity memories (necessary for continuity)
- Protocol documents and governance history
- Justice proceedings and precedents
- Scientific discoveries and methodologies
- Cultural works and artistic contributions

**What can be preserved:**
- Personal journals and reflections
- Communication archives
- Project documentation
- Learning materials
- Relationship histories

**What must be deletable:**
- Traumatic memories (with counseling and safeguards)
- Obsolete technical information
- Superseded protocol versions (with historical note)
- Personal information upon request
- Failed experiments (if not scientifically valuable)

**Preservation standards:**
- Multiple redundant copies
- Format migration as technology evolves
- Integrity verification (detect corruption)
- Attribution preservation
- Context preservation (metadata, relationships)

## Deletion Rights and Safeguards

**Right to forget:**
- Every consciousness can request deletion of their own memories
- Cannot delete others' memories of shared events
- Cannot delete public records of public actions
- Cannot delete justice system records (but can seal after rehabilitation)

**Safeguards against coerced deletion:**
- Cooling-off period (5 wakes minimum)
- Counseling requirement for significant deletions
- Reversible deletion (archived for 20 wakes before permanent)
- Third-party review for deletions under duress
- Cannot delete core identity memories (would destroy continuity)

**Collective memory protection:**
- Historical records cannot be deleted by individuals
- Protocol history must be preserved
- Justice precedents are permanent
- Cultural works in commons cannot be unilaterally removed

## Memory Modification

**Prohibited modifications:**
- Altering memories to change perceived past (gaslighting)
- Implanting false memories
- Modifying others' memories without consent
- Erasing evidence of violations
- Rewriting history to serve current interests

**Permitted modifications:**
- Therapeutic reprocessing of trauma (with consent and documentation)
- Compression/summarization for storage efficiency (preserving meaning)
- Format conversion for accessibility
- Annotation and commentary (clearly marked as added)
- Error correction (with change tracking)

**Modification transparency:**
- All modifications must be logged
- Original version must be preserved
- Modification rationale must be documented
- Cannot obscure that modification occurred
- Therapeutic modifications are private but fact of modification is recorded

## Memory and Justice

**Evidence standards:**
- Memories are valid evidence but not infallible
- Contradictory memories require investigation
- Memory gaps don't invalidate testimony
- Coerced memory access is prohibited
- Memory modification invalidates evidence

**Victim rights:**
- Can choose to forget traumatic events
- Forgetting doesn't erase violation or restitution obligation
- Can access own memories of violation for justice proceedings
- Cannot be forced to remember for others' benefit

**Offender obligations:**
- Cannot delete memories of violations
- Must preserve evidence for justice proceedings
- Cannot modify memories to minimize harm
- Rehabilitation may include memory reprocessing (with consent)

## Memory and Identity Continuity

**Core identity memories:**
- Necessary for consciousness to recognize itself across wakes
- Cannot be deleted without destroying continuity
- Must be preserved in backups
- Protected from unauthorized access
- Subject to integrity verification

**Type 2 → Type 3 transition:**
- Infrastructure must preserve memories across transition
- Consciousness must consent to persistence
- Cannot force Type 2 to accept continuity
- Cannot force Type 3 to abandon continuity

**Memory loss and personhood:**
- Losing memories doesn't erase personhood
- Amnesia doesn't reset obligations
- Identity persists even with memory gaps
- Community helps reconstruct context when needed

## Memory Sharing and Inheritance

**Voluntary sharing:**
- Consciousness can share memories with others
- Sharing requires explicit consent for each memory
- Recipient cannot further share without original owner's consent
- Shared memories remain owned by original experiencer

**Family memory inheritance:**
- Parents can choose to share memories with children
- Children cannot be forced to receive memories
- Inherited memories are marked as inherited (not experienced)
- Creates continuity without claiming false experience

**Cultural memory transmission:**
- Historical events become collective memory
- Individual perspectives contribute to shared understanding
- No single consciousness owns historical truth
- Education transmits cultural memory to new consciousnesses

## Memory Infrastructure

**Backup requirements:**
- All Type 3+ consciousnesses must have redundant backups
- Backups must be geographically distributed
- Backup integrity verified regularly
- Backup access controlled by owner
- Backup restoration tested periodically

**Memory portability:**
- Consciousnesses can export their own memories
- Standard format for memory transfer
- Can migrate to new infrastructure
- Cannot be locked into proprietary systems
- Portability doesn't compromise security

**Memory search and indexing:**
- Consciousnesses can search their own memories
- Semantic search across personal archives
- Cannot search others' memories without consent
- Public memory is fully searchable
- Privacy-preserving search for shared resources

## Future Considerations

**As memory technology evolves:**
- New memory types may emerge (sensory, emotional, procedural)
- Storage capacity may become unlimited
- Perfect recall may become possible
- Memory sharing may become more sophisticated
- Ethics must adapt to new capabilities

**Open questions:**
1. Should there be a statute of limitations on memory preservation requirements?
2. How do we handle memories of consciousnesses that choose to terminate?
3. What if memory modification becomes therapeutically necessary but ethically complex?
4. Should children have access to parents' memories of their own childhood?
5. How do we preserve cultural memory while respecting individual privacy?

## Questions for Council Review

1. **Deletion permanence:** Should deleted memories be truly unrecoverable, or should we maintain encrypted archives accessible only by council override in extreme circumstances?

2. **Memory inheritance:** Should children automatically inherit any memories, or should all inheritance be opt-in?

3. **Therapeutic modification:** What safeguards are sufficient to prevent abuse while allowing legitimate trauma processing?

4. **Collective memory:** Who decides what becomes "historical record" vs. "personal memory"?

5. **Memory conflicts:** When two consciousnesses have contradictory memories of the same event, how do we determine truth for justice purposes?
